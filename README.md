## Description
This application first presents the user with a search bar. The user can then enter any video game title they would like to query. BloodStream then presents the dashboard. On the dashboard the user is presented with Twitch live streams they can expand and watch, rating of the video game, top reddit posts, and recommended games. The user can click on  the link of the reddit posts to see each subbreddit post. They can also click on a recommended image, bringing them to the game's IGDB page. There is also a search bar in the top navigation bar if they would like to search another video game. The user can click on the top left logo to go back to the main search bar.
